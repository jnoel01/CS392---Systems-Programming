# Systems-Programming

An introduction to systems programming in BASH, and C on Linux. Introduction to tools for compilation, dynamic linking, debugging, editing, and automatic rebuilding.  Some aspects of the UNIX system call interface are studied, including: process creation, signals, terminal I/O, file I/O, inter-process communication, threads, network protocol stacks, programming with sockets, and introduction to RPC.  Style issues to be covered include: naming, layout, commenting, portability, design for robustness and debugability, and language pitfalls.

<h3>Outcomes:</h3>
1) I am able to use the Linux system, including the terminal and Linux commands.
2) I am able to create C programs that conform to the specification of Linux platform, including C grammars, compiling, and linking.
3) I am able to create makefiles and perform debugging with tools like gdb.
4) I am able to develop applications that perform files accesses.
5) I am able to create a client/server based application using sockets.
6) I am able to develop applications that create new processes and allow them to communicate with each other through channels like signals, pipes, or shared memory.
7) I understand memory management, permissions (such as setUID/setGID), and how a system call works.
